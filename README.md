Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Project
=================================

Repository for course project

The "run_analysis.R" file is expecting to have the following files in the working directory:
X_train.txt, X_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt, activity_labels.txt, features.txt

It will then run completely, and output a file called "final_data.R" upon competion.

All code commenting (and logic) is in the "run_analysis.R" file.
